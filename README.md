# UlitimateTicTacToe

My project for my CSA final. 2022-2023 class year. It is a Ultimate tic tac toe game that is played in the terminal. Link to the rules can be found [here](https://github.com/SGlombicki/UlitimateTicTacToe/blob/master/Rules.md). You can download the game from the releases it was compiled with OpenJDK 19.
